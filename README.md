# Laptop Stickers

These are stickers. I ([@mikemaccana](http://twitter.com/mikemaccana)) might have printed them out for you and gave them to you at some event somewhere.

The MongoDB quote is by [@slexaxton](http://twitter.com/slexaxton), I just licensed the right font and did the artwork. The horse.js belongs to [@horse_js](http://twitter.com/horse_js), I found a higher res image of the mask and recreated it the image in higher res. The rest are from [@mikemaccana](http://twitter.com/mikemaccana).

If you like them, please:

 - Print them and give them away. In Europe, [Diginate](https://diginate.com), in the US [Stickermule](https://stickermule.com).
 - Give me credit for making them (maybe a link to me or this repo) if you show them off on social media.
 - Feel free to send me a pull request and add more!
